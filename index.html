        <p><em>If you want a phone call, e-mail me to schedule it, even if you want to talk the same day.</em></p>
        <p>Some lawyers are on the phone all day. Some lawyers read and write all day. I read and write all day. My number one working priority is <a href="#deep-tasks">defending the long, uninterrupted time slots I need</a> to get deep, demanding work done carefully and completely.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="number-2">
        <p><em>Send a separate e-mail, with a different subject line, for each deal or project.</em></p>
        <p>I will get three things done faster if you send me three different e-mails, with three different subject lines, in three minutes, than I will if you send me one e-mail about all of them.</p>
      </li>

        <p><em>If you spot a way we can improve how we work together, don’t hold back! Let me know!</em></p>
        <p>I wrote a whole webpage about this. It’s only fair!</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
    <p>Most tasks coming my way from clients fall into a few rough categories:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt id="quick-asks">Quick Asks</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Small-scope questions and request that I can handle offhand, usually in just a few minutes. Questions about legal rules I know well. Requests for documents in my records. Status reports on projects.</p>
        <p>I try to handle quick asks as soon as possible, as they come up. Even if I have other kinds of tasks on my to-do list for the day. My goal here is to prevent people waiting on me, and to prevent mounds and mounds of these piling up. If they pile up, it’s often as much work to track them as to do them, so it’s easy to drown.</p>
        <p>This sometimes frustrate clients who see me answering unrelated questions when a much larger task is acknowledged first priority.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="shallow-tasks">Shallow Tasks</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>These require some focus or concentration, but come in under half an hour or so. Quick reads of, or tweaks to, contracts and proposals. Small updates to forms and public policies already fresh in mind. That sort of thing.</p>
        <p>I also try to clear these immediately. But I will postpone them to defend a morning, afternoon, or evening block needed for a larger task.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="deep-tasks">Deep Tasks</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>These require me to unplug from everything else and focus exclusively on one project for a substantial amount of time. Reviewing and turning drafts of long or complex contracts. Grappling with new developments in law or regulation. Researching a specific question of law.</p>
        <p>I typically schedule deep tasks to large blocks of time—morning, afternoon, or evening. Then I have to “defend” that block from encroachment by other tasks. Some deep tasks take a whole working day or more. I try to work these as scheduled. However, “emergency” or highly time-sensitive items occasionally ruin my plans.</p>
        <p>From experience, I’ve learned that if I do two deep tasks in a day—say, one full-morning job and one full-afternoon job—I can’t keep up quality for a third in the same day. The evening is good for quick and small tasks only. Same if I do a single large job spanning morning and afternoon or afternoon and evening. My chances of an oversight or significant mistake drop in a big way if I can postpone the third job to the next day.</p>
        <p>Mornings, afternoons, and evenings free of commitments and interruptions are the precious coins of my realm. I fight to save up for them, and to defend them from my clients, so I can get heavy lifting done. Realistically, I only get a handful of open deep-tasks slots per week, for all my clients.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="appointments">Appointments</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Anything else that gets calendared. These work largely to disqualify large time blocks from assignment to deep tasks. If schedule a call on Tuesday morning, I can’t do a deep dive on a contract that morning. If I have to dial into a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, I can’t do a big job that takes two slows in a row—morning and afternoon, afternoon and evening—on that day.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2 id="proofing">Proofing</h2>
    <p>A quick note on re-reviews, proofreading, and “working on my own work” generally.</p>
    <p>I can’t competently check my own work shortly after I’ve just done it. I need to set my work aside for some time—to focus on other, unrelated projects or clients—in order to come back to my prior work with anything like a fresh eye.</p>
    <p>This primarily affects turnaround times on large contract, where my client has received a lengthy proposal on a form I’ve never seen before. I may complete a review, issue summary, and markup of a fifty page proposal on Monday. But if it’s sensitive, I’m really going to want to set it aside for a day or two and return to it again before finalizing. That review will be another large job, which means blocking off and defending another uninterrupted chunk of time.</p>
    <p>I don’t usually tell clients when I’m doing this, because even though they almost always understand intellectually, it’s inherently frustrating waiting on your lawyer while they intentionally don’t think about your project. It’s also awkward admitting that I’m essentially incompetent to do so until I’ve forgot about the job for a while.</p>
    <h2 id="lingo">Deal Lingo</h2>
    <p>I like to say that it’s my job to learn your language, not your job to learn mine. But there is some common lingo used broadly negotiations, by lawyers and businesspeople alike. You are probably better off learning and using that lingo than relying on me to translate for you, especially on <a href="#all-call">all calls</a>.</p>
    <p>There isn’t any standard or official dictionary of these terms. But the following reflects consistent usage I’ve seen in negotiations, usually among American or British lawyers.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn id="all-call">All Call</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a phone call where both lawyers and businesspeople for both sides get invited</p>

      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="balanced-call">Balanced Call</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>an <a href="#all-call">all call</a> where each side has both a lawyer and a businessperson present</p>
        <p>Compare <a href="#unbalanced-call">unbalanced call</a>.</p>
      </dd>

        <p>Some lawyers still physically print and bind closing binders. But ever more often, these are just big PDF files or ZIP archives.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="definitive-agreement">Definitive Agreement</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>the written agreement that both sides will sign when the deal is done</p>
        <p>Contrast <a href="#term-sheet">term sheet</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="file-copy">File Copy</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>the final copy of a <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a> with signatures from both sides</p>
        <p>File copies are the primary evidence both sides keep that a contract was made, in case they need to enforce their contract.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="initial-proposal">Initial Proposal</dfn> or <dfn id="first-draft">First Draft</dfn></dt>

      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="opposing-counsel">Opposing Counsel</dfn></dt>

      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="redline">Redline</dfn> or <dfn id="blackline">Blackline</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a document of a <a href="#turn">turn</a> formatted to show the changes made to the last <a href="#turn">turn</a></p>
        <p>Akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> in computer programming.</p>

      <dd>
        <p>language called out in a <a href="#turn">turn</a> for comment in a later <a href="#turn">turn</a></p>
        <p>Negotiators often reserve comment when they aren’t yet sure if they can accept proposed language, or when they need more information or approvals from others. Somtimes negotiators reserve comment tactically, to avoid revealing their view or distract from other issues.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="retrading">Retrading</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>going back on issues that were considered <a href="#closed-issue">closed</a>, or sending a <a href="#turn">turn</a> with edits to <a href="#settled-language">settled language</a> not connected to any <a href="#open-issue">open issue</a>.</p>
        <p>Retrading is looked down upon, and often results in reduced trust between negotiating parties.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="settled-language">Settled Language</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>language in a <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a> that one side proposed in a <a href="#turn">turn</a> and the other side did not either change in their next <a href="#turn">turn</a> or <a href="#reserve-for-comment">reserve for comment</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="signature-proposal">Signature Proposal</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a <a href="#turn">turn</a> with all outstanding issues resolved that a party proposes as ready sign</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="term-sheet"><dfn>Term Sheet</dfn> or <dfn id="letter-of-intent">Letter of Intent</dfn> or <dfn id="memorandum-of-understanding">Memorandum of Understanding</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a short document, prepared before any <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a> that outlines the major terms of a tranaction</p>
        <p>Term sheets are faster to write, easier to change, and friendlier to hands-on work by businesspeople, and not just lawyers. They can help to pin down the most important terms of a negotiation ahead of time, and create a record each side can point back to if the other tries to <a href="#retrading">retrade</a>.</p>
        <p>Term sheets are not usually binding contracts. However, in some kinds of deals, like venture capital financings, term sheets may combine non-binding outlines of terms with binding exclusivity agreements.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="the-pen">The Pen</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>figurative concept for which side will take the next <a href="#turn">turn</a></p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“You have the pen.” means “Your side will take the next <a href="#turn">turn</a>.”
          </li>
          <li>“If you’re alright with us going out of order, we will take back the pen.” means “If you approve, we will take the next turn, even though we took the last turn.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="turn">Turn</dfn> or <dfn id="markup">Markup</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a set of documents showing proposed changes to a <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a> and any related documents</p>
        <p>After the <a href="#initial-proposal">initial proposal</a>, each turn usually includes a <a href="#clean-copy">clean copy</a> and <a href="#reline">redline</a> of each document with proposed changes, plus any comments included in the e-mail or other messages sending them.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="unbalanced-call">Unbalanced Call</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>an <a href="#all-call">all call</a> where one side lacks either a lawyer or a businessperson on the line</p>
        <p>In general, according to the ethical rules for the practice of law, lawyers shouldn’t speak to people they know have their own lawyers without those lawyers present.</p>
