    <h1>Deal Lingo</h1>
    <p>legal negotiation terms and phrases</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>I like to say that it’s my job to learn your language, not your job to learn mine. But there is some common lingo used broadly negotiations, by lawyers and businesspeople alike. You are probably better off learning and using that lingo than relying on me to translate for you, especially on <a href="#all-call">all calls</a>.</p>
    <p>There isn’t any standard or official dictionary of these terms. But the following reflects consistent usage I’ve seen in negotiations, usually among American or British lawyers.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn id="all-call">All Call</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a phone call where both lawyers and businesspeople for both sides get invited</p>
        <p>Compare <a href="#lawyers-call">lawyers call</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="authority">Authority</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a person’s ability to make binding commitments for their side</p>
        <p>The most important authority is signing authority, the legal right to sign contracts on behalf of a legal entity. But lawyers and negotiators often claim, and sometimes have, effective authority to take final negotiating positions on specific points of a deal.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="balanced-call">Balanced Call</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>an <a href="#all-call">all call</a> where each side has both a lawyer and a businessperson present</p>
        <p>Compare <a href="#unbalanced-call">unbalanced call</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="clean-copy">Clean Copy</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a document of a <a href="#turn">turn</a> with all proposed changes accepted and all comments removed</p>
        <p>Contrast <a href="#redline">redline</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="closed-issue">Closed Issue</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a term of a deal on which both sides have come to a common understanding</p>
        <p>Contrast <a href="#open-issue">open issue</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="closing-binder">Closing Binder</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>for complex transactions involving many <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreements</a> or other documents, an organized set of all <a href="#file-copy">file copies</a></p>
        <p>Some lawyers still physically print and bind closing binders. But ever more often, these are just big PDF files or ZIP archives.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="data-room">Data Room</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>anachronistic term for the collection of records made available for <a href="#due-diligence">due diligence</a></p>
        <p>Data rooms used to be physical rooms stuffed with paper records. Nowadays “digital data rooms” are often online shared folders of PDF and other computer files.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="definitive-agreement">Definitive Agreement</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>the written agreement that both sides will sign when the deal is done</p>
        <p>Contrast <a href="#term-sheet">term sheet</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="due-diligence">Due Diligence</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>research on the other side or important aspect of a deal, such as property to be purchased</p>
        <p>Due diligence frequently involves one side providing corporate records or other private documents to the other side for review.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="exhibit">Exhibit</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>an agreement or form of agreement attached to a <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a></p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a voting agreement attached to a stock purchase agreement</li>
          <li>a form of stock purchase agreement attached to a stock option grant</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some lawyers use “exhibit” and <a href="#schedule">“schedule”</a> more or less interchangeably.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="file-copy">File Copy</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>the final copy of a <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a> with signatures from both sides</p>
        <p>File copies are the primary evidence both sides keep that a contract was made, in case they need to enforce their contract.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="initial-proposal">Initial Proposal</dfn> or <dfn id="first-draft">First Draft</dfn></dt>

      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="issues-list">Issues List</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a list of open issues from one side or the other</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="lawyers-call">Lawyers Call</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a phone call where only the lawyers for each side get invited, not the businesspeople</p>
        <p>Compare <a href="#all-call">all call</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="master-agreement">Master Agreement</dfn></dt>

      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="late-hit">Late Hit</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>an instance of <a href="#retrading">retrading</a> where one side asks for a substantial new concession in a later <a href="#turn">turn</a> that they could have asked for or warned about earlier</p>
        <p>People sometimes honestly forget points they need or want on a deal. But allowing new proposals on <a href="#closed-issue">closed issues</a> invites manipulation of timing and path-dependencies under the guise of simple ignorance or forgetfulness.</p>
        <p>Late hits often come in the form of real or supposed demands from higher-level reviewers, superior management, or others with <a href="#authority">authority</a> who didn’t directly participate in earlier stages of negotiations. Savvy negotiators often try to head off these kinds of late hits by asking negotiators to clarify their <a href="#authority">authority</a> before accepting any concessions.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="open-issue">Open Issue</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a term of a deal on which both sides have not yet come to a common understanding</p>

      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="paper">Paper</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>figurative concept for form agreements and other documents</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“We’re happy to start from your paper.” means “We’re open to you preparing the <a href="#initial-proposal">initial proposal</a> using your company’s forms.”
          </li>
          <li>“Their paper likely isn’t anything but bad for us.” means “Their forms likely favor their interests strongly over ours.”</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="the-pen">The Pen</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>figurative concept for which side will take the next <a href="#turn">turn</a></p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“You have the pen.” means “Your side will take the next <a href="#turn">turn</a>.”
          </li>
          <li>“If you’re alright with us going out of order, we will take back the pen.” means “If you approve, we will take the next turn, even though we took the last turn.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="playbook">Playbook</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a documented set of changes that negotiators are authorized to make, and the conditions under which they can offer them</p>
        <p>Businesses with organized sales teams sometimes prepare playbooks to regulate how their salespeople can negotiate deals on their <a href="#paper">paper</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="redline">Redline</dfn> or <dfn id="blackline">Blackline</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a document of a <a href="#turn">turn</a> formatted to show the changes made to the last <a href="#turn">turn</a></p>
        <p>Akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> in computer programming.</p>
        <p>Lawyers typically use Microsoft Word’s Track Changes or Compare Document functions, or a purpose-built legal comparison program, some of which output PDFs rather than Word files.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="representation">Representation</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>sometimes a specific legal term of art, but more often a general term for statements of past or present fact made by one side in a contract, with legal responsibility if they turn out false</p>
        <p>Often seen in “representations and <a href="#warranties">warranties</a>”.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="reserve-for-comment">Reserve for Comment</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>language called out in a <a href="#turn">turn</a> for comment in a later <a href="#turn">turn</a></p>
        <p>Negotiators often reserve comment when they aren’t yet sure if they can accept proposed language, or when they need more information or approvals from others. Somtimes negotiators reserve comment tactically, to avoid revealing their view or distract from other issues.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="retrading">Retrading</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>going back on issues that were considered <a href="#closed-issue">closed</a>, or sending a <a href="#turn">turn</a> with edits to <a href="#settled-language">settled language</a> not connected to any <a href="#open-issue">open issue</a>.</p>
        <p>Retrading is looked down upon, and often harms credibility and trust between negotiating parties.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="sandbagging">Sandbagging</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>signing a <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a> when you know the other side’s <a href="#representation">representations</a> or <a href="#warranty">warranties</a> are false, with an eye toward suing them for breach</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="schedule">Schedule</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a document attached to a <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a></p>
        <p>Some lawyers use “schedule” and <a href="#exhibit">“exhibit”</a> more or less interchangeably.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="settled-language">Settled Language</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>language in a <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a> that one side proposed in a <a href="#turn">turn</a> and the other side did not either change in their next <a href="#turn">turn</a> or <a href="#reserve-for-comment">reserve for comment</a>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="signature-proposal">Signature Proposal</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a <a href="#turn">turn</a> with all outstanding issues resolved that a party proposes as ready sign</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="term-sheet"><dfn>Term Sheet</dfn> or <dfn id="letter-of-intent">Letter of Intent</dfn> or <dfn id="memorandum-of-understanding">Memorandum of Understanding</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a short document, prepared before any <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a> that outlines the major terms of a tranaction</p>
        <p>Term sheets are faster to write, easier to change, and friendlier to hands-on work by businesspeople, and not just lawyers. They can help to pin down the most important terms of a negotiation ahead of time, and create a record each side can point back to if the other tries to <a href="#retrading">retrade</a>.</p>
        <p>Term sheets are not usually binding contracts. However, in some kinds of deals, like venture capital financings, term sheets may combine non-binding outlines of terms with binding exclusivity agreements.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="turn">Turn</dfn> or <dfn id="markup">Markup</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>a set of documents showing proposed changes to a <a href="#definitive-agreement">definitive agreement</a> and any related documents</p>
        <p>After the <a href="#initial-proposal">initial proposal</a>, each turn usually includes a <a href="#clean-copy">clean copy</a> and <a href="#reline">redline</a> of each document with proposed changes, plus any comments included in the e-mail or other messages sending them.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="unbalanced-call">Unbalanced Call</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>an <a href="#all-call">all call</a> where one side lacks either a lawyer or a businessperson on the line</p>
        <p>In general, according to the ethical rules for the practice of law, lawyers shouldn’t speak to people they know have their own lawyers without those lawyers present.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn id="warranty">Warranty</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>sometimes a specific legal term of art, but more often a general term for statements of future fact made by one side in a contract, with legal responsibility if they turn out false</p>
        <p>Often seen in “<a href="#representation">representations</a> and warranties”.</p>
